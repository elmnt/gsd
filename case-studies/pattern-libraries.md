{% include section-title.html label="Impact" %}

- Delivered a themeable pattern library that extends Walmart's core design system, using design tokens.
- Created molecules, organisms, and templates to address needs specific to Walmart's enterprise/partner business pillar.
- Shipped the library and set up a governance model to support ~60 designers, ~200 web engineers.
- Replaced multiple single, independently managed product libraries.

{% include copy-block.html copy="We want to transplant this same process and structure into our two remaining business pillars. What went well, and what did we learn? Below are just a few highlighted points from our extensive retro." %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="What went well?" %}

- Delivering complex components that multiple teams were maintaining independently, and in a way that did not adhere to design system best practices.
- Cross-team collaboration is good for culture. We need to deeply understand the different problems that product and systems teams are solving, in order to find those middle grounds.
- More and faster success with the governance models built and tested over time by the design system team.

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Focus for improvement" %}

- Initial requirements contained a lot of undefined assumptions. Product teams and system teams see things differently. We should spend more time establishing preliminary hand-shake agreements.
- Product designers have very biased opinions about component structure, library structure, and governance. The design system team should have been given more "final gavel" authority over the nuts-and-bolts of library structure and delivery.
- Engineering commitment is necessary from "square one." We were dealing with a waterfall culture, and we could have moved more quickly with more leadership/stakeholder commitment. Follow the design system team's agile process for better results.
