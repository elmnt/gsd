{% include section-title-list.html label="Impact" %}

- Delivered complex organisms in Walmart's Enterprise business pillar to ~60 designers and ~200 web engineering partners.
- Replaced multiple Filter Panel components found in single-product subsystems, all with unique visual inconsistencies, managed by multiple teams.
- Estimating the removal of hours spent by individual teams building and owning custom Filter Panel components, the savings per year add up quickly. We don't have concrete data on this, but some "estimation math" can be enlightening.
	- ~60 designers and ~200 engineers in this business pillar
	- If ~5 designers & ~10 engineers, representing work in the 5 sub-pillars are each owning these patterns, spending 4 hours/week customizing and maintaining them...
	- It's reasonable to assume 960 hours/year (at $96K per year) is a **low** estimate of resources spent on inconsistent artifacts in design and code, for this one component.
