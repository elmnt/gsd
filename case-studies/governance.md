{% include section-title.html label="Summary" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="I was part of the zero-to-one team that built the first centralized, governed design system library at Walmart. Over time, we established rules and processes that ensured system stability and growth. I led the effort to define and document these foundational processes, which helped:" %}

- Define the scope of our team within the design organization.
- Define basic roles and responsibilities of designers and engineers on our team.
- Communicate "how we work" principles to new system team members, product design users, engineering users, product partners, and business partners.
- Manage the flow of work.
- Manage user expectations when making requests of the team. 

{% include section-title.html label="Challenge" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="A design system needs user input and collaboration for healthy growth. One of the primary challenges can be managing team capacity when user input accelerates. Clear, documented process serves a few crucial functions:" %}

- It helps communicate the team's capacity.
- It sets user expectations, when requesting updates and iterations.
- It ensures the work we deliver will be stable and reliable on all platforms.

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Iteration 1: Intricate roadmap" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="This represents early efforts to define every step in the component/pattern process. The idea was that, if all steps could be accounted for, we minimize the chance of shipping artifacts that fail to meet user needs. The intricacy proved to be challenging in the course of a busy, demanding team sprint. It's important to find a balance between progress and process. Too much process can hinder progress." %}

{% include figure.html image="case-studies/governance-1a.png" caption="Intricate roadmap section" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Tested over time, individual sections of this documentation were helpful tools to introduce new team members to the intricacies of design system work. But, taken as a whole, it was difficult to use as a strict tool for team collaboration. Team members need to be trusted to manage their own individual tasks with a bit more freedom." %}

{% include section-title.html label="Learnings" %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Iteration 2: Simplified approach" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As a design system (and its team) gains maturity, it's easier to embrace the progress-over-process ideal. Individual team members have a more concrete understanding of expectations. It's important that we hit key milestones in our process, but it's more important that we do so with realistic velocity." %}

{% include figure-big.html image="case-studies/governance-2.png" caption="Simplified approach" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Defining a process more simply allows the team to adhere to the most fundamental best practices, while not getting bogged down in micro-management of their work. And, more important, the documented process becomes an artifact that we can share with users, to help them understand how our team functions." %}

{% include figure.html image="case-studies/governance-2a.png" caption="Simplified approach section" %}

Users will commonly ask why a design system task can't be completed on a timeline that aligns with delivery of their product. This is an artifact we can share that demonstrates the necessary steps we take, and clearly explains how system work is intentionally different than product work.

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Iteration 3: Modify for scale" %}

{% include figure-big.html image="case-studies/governance-3.png" caption="Modify for scale" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="A well-established design system process can be implemented in other parts of the business, when product-focused systems need to be built. Product designers can quickly and easily adhere to this workflow, with some design system oversight, and any system artifacts they deliver will be more likely to meet our standards." %}

{% include figure.html image="case-studies/governance-3a.png" caption="Modify for scale section" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Processes vary based on the project intention and the requirements of the product design directors, but if we adhere to the skeleton of the design system's methodology, we deliver reliable components and patterns, and our users have a clear understanding of our role and our timeline." %}
